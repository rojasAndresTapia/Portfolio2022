        <p>
          I am a Front End Developer / Graphic Designer from Chile. I studied
          Hotel Management in Santiago, and after my first work experience in
          the experience in the HR area, I decided to travel and open my mind to
          new opportunities. Since 2010, I have been living in Spain. I have
          worked in different projects designing webs, corporate image, digital
          image and video. In my current job, i am responsible for the area of
          design and support of a company that has developed a software for
          construction and installation companies, facilitating their digital
          transformation process. Currently, I am expanding my competences in
          the area of web development through Lemoncode's Front End Master.
