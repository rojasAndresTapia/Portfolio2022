        <p>
          I am a Front End Developer coming from the Graphic Design area. I'm
          from Chile and since 2009 I live in Spain. I have worked in different
          projects of web design, corporate image, digital image and video. In
          the last project I was involved, I was responsible for the design and
          support area in a startup that has developed a software for
          construction and installation companies, facilitating their digital
          transformation process.
        </p>

          Currently, I am expanding my skills in the area of web development
          through the Lemoncode Front End Master that I am about to finish. Also
          with personal projects like this portfolio, configured with
          <strong> Webpack</strong>, developed with <strong>React</strong>,
          typed with
          <strong> Typescript</strong>, styled with <strong>Emotion</strong> and
          published with <strong>Github Action</strong>.
